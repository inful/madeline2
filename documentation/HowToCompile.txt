Notes on Compiling Madeline

Required Tools
==============

The following software tools may be required before you can
build Madeline:

1. SVN: http://subversion.tigris.org/ 

You may need an SVN client in order to checkout the latest code
from our code repository.  You must use svn+ssh to access 
our repository:

~> svn co svn+ssh://retina.ophthy.med.umich.edu/SVN/madeline2/trunk madeline2

The first time you check out the code, SVN may ask you for your 
password as many as three times.  After that, SVN will normally ask
you for your password only once.

2. CMake: http://cmake.org/

The CMake build system is used instead of the GNU automake and
autoconf system that you may be more familiar with.  Once you 
have checked out Madeline, enter the Madeline directory and run
ccmake in order to configure interactively.  Be sure to include
the "." indicating the current directory:

~> cd madeline2
~> ccmake .

CCMake is a curses configuration client.  You can also use the
command-line client, cmake :

~> cmake .


Required Libraries
==================

1. LibXML2

2. Pango

3. LASi


GCC Compiler
============

By default, the CMake build system will look for a working GCC
compiler.


Intel ICC Compiler
==================

You need to tell CMake if you want to use Intel's ICC compiler.
Be sure to provide the actual paths to the icc and icpc executables.
Depending on your platform and how you install ICC, you might have
symbolic links in /usr/bin or in /usr/local/bin, or you might even
have to specify the full path in /opt/intel/... :

~> CC=/usr/bin/icc CXX=/usr/bin/icpc ccmake .

... or:

~> CC=/usr/bin/icc CXX=/usr/bin/icpc cmake .
