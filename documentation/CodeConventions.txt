Coding Conventions
==================

(1) Use an editor capable of handling UTF-8 Unicode
    correctly.  Be careful! -- We have some code files
    that contain UTF-8-encoded strings directly in the
    code.  These might be code comments, ANSI C "char *"
    strings, std::strings or some derived string class.
    
(2) Private member variables and methods should start
    with an underscore.  This makes it very easy to
    distinguish between local variables and variables that
    are private within the class.  It also makes it
    easier to spot the private methods when you are
    browsing through the code.  For example, in the 
    Data class, getDataType(void) is a public method
    while _displayNativeDigitsInDates is a private 
    static boolean variable.
    
(3) Use pointers to large objects to avoid unnecessary
    and expensive copies.
