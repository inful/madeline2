Revision 7: Contains the code that can draw SINGLE Descent Tree pedigrees.
	    Also, tested for pedigrees with CONSANG+Multiple Spouses
 
1. When consanguinity is found the individual with a lower id is assumed to be
   on the Left Side of Loop and the spouse then belongs to the Right Side of Loop.

2. When an indiviudal has multiple spouses NuclearFamily(index) is sorted based on    the spouse id. NuclearFamily(0)  corresponds to the spouse with lowest id and so   on.

3. When an individual has multiple spouses the default is to draw the first spouse    on the right, then the next on the left, the one after on the right and so on.
   So if there are 3 spouses, 2 will be on the right and one will be on the left.

4. In determining the order of siblings for CLASSICAL ordering the following is assumed:
    LSL1	LSL2	LSL3			RSL3	RSL2	RSL1
    ----------------------->			<------------------
